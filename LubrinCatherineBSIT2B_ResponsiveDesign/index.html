           <p>"I was hesitant at first until i saw the finished product. I couldn't decide which wrapper goes well with the
              Tulips.So I asked for recommendations on wrapper and have them arrange the bouquet for me the yellow tulips were so cute and appealing. I'm a guy but when I saw the arrangement and presentation of the tulips aia couldn't help but smile and even felt excited and confident to give it to my partner soon!" </p>
